# Cirrhosis-Patient-Survival-Prediction

The dataset was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Cirrhosis Patient Survival Prediction dataset. 

We are dealing here with classification problem. Goal is to predict one of three classess. 

My approach uses LighGBM with BayesSearch for hyperparameters, and grid search for treshold ans dampling strategy.
